The model should respond with a string array containing certain predefined items: Functional Suitability, Performance Efficiency, Compatibility, Interaction Capability, Reliability, Security, Maintainability, Flexibility, and Safety.\\n\\nThe user provided a sample review which is a bit informal but mentions that the app shuts down when opened, causing the user to go back to their home page after refreshing. The key negative experience here seems to be related to the app shutting down unexpectedly, which affects functionality. \\n\\nI need to check if this issue falls under any of the listed categories. Functional Suitability is about whether the app meets the user\\'s needs as stated or implied. Since the app is malfunctioning when opened, it doesn\\'t perform its intended function properly, so that definitely falls under Functional Suitability.\\n\\nAre there other applicable categories? Maybe Security because if the app is crashing due to an unforeseen issue like a crash caused by a bug in the app itself rather than malicious actors, but I don\\'t see Security as the primary fit here. The main issue is about functionality failing when it shouldn\\'t, so Functional Suitability seems accurate.\\n\\nI should make sure that only these categories are considered and nothing else. The response needs to be exactly one of the predefined strings or an empty array if none apply. In this case, since the problem relates directly to Functional Suitability, I\\'ll include that in the result.\\n</think>\\n\\n[\"Functional Suitability\"]'"
